# PayLane REST Ruby client

The PayLane Ruby client is a wrapper for our RESTful API, allowing you to quickly integrate your services with our payment gateway. These clients have undergone tests to ensure they work out of the box, and are regularly maintained by PayLane. If you notice any bugs, please report them.

# Official documentation 

Code snippets, full API documetation, plugins, integration examples and much more can be found in the [PayLane DevZone](http://devzone.paylane.com/api-guide/).

All the code examples in the Developer Zone are based on these official REST clients.
